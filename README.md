# Firefox Themes
All themes use [Stylish's](https://userstyles.org/) [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome) and fully customizable in CSS.

## Known Problems
See [issues](https://github.com/fireclaw722/Firefox-Stylish-Themes/issues). I currently add things as I find them, if you find a possible issue, check there or fill out a bug report.

## Themes

### Strontium
Custom built theme. Named from the element, Sr (Strontium), because of it's highly reactive behavior. **Theme may break often.**

### Paper
